# pdomain-ops

Library + tiny CLI providing suite plumbing, shared prefs, and GPU dispatch adapters
for the pdomain-* suite.

`pdomain-ops` is a library (not a daemon) that runs in-process inside each pdomain-* app's
FastAPI server. It provides:

- **Suite registry** (`installed.toml`): apps self-register so the AppShell launcher
  can discover and spawn siblings.
- **Shared UI prefs** (`ui-prefs.json`): cross-app theme, density, accent color,
  layer colors, and per-app extension blobs.
- **Sibling launcher**: spawn sibling apps by binary, poll `/healthz`, surface
  the URL.
- **Auth and storage adapters**: local-mode stubs; Phase 4 adds cloud backends.
- **GPU dispatch adapters**: `StageDispatcher` for short page-level calls,
  `LongJobRunner` (SQLite-backed) for training runs and batch jobs.

## Quick start

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pdomain_ops import mount_routes

app = FastAPI()
mount_routes(app)  # adds /api/suite/*
```

## Dynamic-port SPA bootstrap

SPAs use `find_available_port` to avoid `EADDRINUSE` crashes when the
preferred port is already taken, and `register_self(actual_port=port)` to
record the real port in the suite registry:

```python
import uvicorn
from pdomain_ops.suite import find_available_port, register_self

PREFERRED_PORT = 8004

def main() -> None:
    port = find_available_port(PREFERRED_PORT)
    register_self(_caller_package="pdomain_ocr_simple_gui", actual_port=port)
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=port)
```

See [`docs/usage/dynamic-port-bootstrap.md`](docs/usage/dynamic-port-bootstrap.md)
for the full pattern including stage-2 adoption notes.

## JSON Schema for downstream codegen

```sh
uv run python -m pdomain_ops.schemas > schemas.json
```

See `pdomain_ops/schemas/emit.py::PUBLIC_MODELS` for the registration surface.

## Design

Full spec: `docs/specs/2026-05-16-cross-cut-design.md` in the workspace.

Phase 1.7 (shipped in v0.2.0): `pdomain-prep-for-pgdp`'s GPU dispatch primitives
(`ModalStageDispatcher`, `SharedContainerStageDispatcher`, `register_default_stages()`)
migrated into `pdomain-ops`. The registry now ships DocTR and Tesseract OCR stages
by default via `register_default_stages()`.
